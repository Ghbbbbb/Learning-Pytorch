This project introduces the basic use of Pytorch, including the following three elements:
### 1.Getting started with Pytorch
Here's a simple introduction to tensor creation, tensor properties and methods, and CUDA tensors. 
### 2.Changes in image shape
Here's a brief overview of methods for changing tensor shapes. 
### 3.Linear regression
And here's a simple explanation of forward and backward propagation in linear regression.
